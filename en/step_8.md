**Add another item**

+ In addition to a fan and a lamp, can you add another item and train your smart classroom assistant to understand your commands for controlling the item?

**Try out different confidence scores**

+ Is 70% the correct confidence score for deciding whether the smart classroom assistant has recognised a command correctly? Experiment with different confidence scores until you have a value that works well for your machine learning model. 

If you choose a number that is too high, the assistant will say “Sorry I’m not sure what you mean” too often. 

If you choose a number that is too low, the assistant will get too many things wrong.

**Real smart assistants**

People have made [their own smart assistants based on Amazon’s Alexa](http://amzn.to/2sxy1hw){:target="_blank"}.
 
People make these assistants the same way that you made yours:
1. First, they create buckets for the types of commands they want their assistants to recognise
1. Then they collect examples of how the commands might be phrased and trained the Alexa-based assistant to understand them
 
+ Find an Alexa Skill that you find interesting and look at the commands it can understand. How would you have trained this program?
